# Computer Graphics

This project was created for my Computer Graphics module. This taught us about computer graphics and how to render them. This was done on the Unity Engine and initially, utilised Unity functions but as the project developed it depended on Unity less and less to function. We each had to create a letter which was the first letter of our name and ultimately render it out onto the screen, fully textured and working.

## Project Structure
### Model
The model contains all data about the model such as all points that it is made up of and the texture of it.

### Pipeline & Outcode
It is the entire process to get it from a bunch of number points to a fully rendered item.

### UV Image
The image which is being displayed on the letter, in this case, a J.

### Misc Files
Various files containing the data and working out of the theory behind it.
